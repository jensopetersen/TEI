      <p>This version of the TEI Guidelines introduces new features
      and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As
      always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a
      consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI
      community using the SourceForge tracking system. If you find
      something you think needs to change in the TEI Guidelines,
      schemas, tools, or website, please submit a feature request or
      bug ticket at <ref target="http://tei.sf.net/"
      >http://tei.sf.net/</ref> for consideration. Lists of <ref

      <!-- Add items below here in the form of: <item><gi>stage</gi>

           />.</item>
      -->

      to be removed 2016-09-09.</item>

      <item>Dozens of links to external resources that have moved or
      disappeared have been fixed or replaced.</item>

      <item>Global elements were added to the content model of
      <gi>personGrp</gi> so that it matches more closely the permitted
      content of <gi>person</gi>, per <ptr
      target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/648/" />.</item>

      <item><q>e-mail</q> is now consistently spelled <q>email</q> per

      TEI XPointer schemes, has been expanded and improved.</item>

      <item><gi>msDesc</gi> now claims membership in <name

      <item>Vestiges of the <q>mandatory when applicable</q> and
      <q>recommended when applicable</q> attribute usage statuses were
      removed per <ptr
      target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/676/"/>.</item>


      <item>Schematron validation now confirms that multiple pointers
      appear in the <att>target</att> attribute on either
      <gi>join</gi> or <gi>link</gi>, and that only a single pointer
      appears in the <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> attributes of
      <gi>span</gi> per <ptr
      target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/671/"/>.</item>

      <item><gi>availability</gi> has been added to <name

      <item>The Guidelines no longer assert on the title page that
      they are published in Charlottesville, Virginia.</item>

      <item><gi>rs</gi> is now a member of <name

      target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/509/"/>.</item>

      <item>The <att>medium</att> attribute of <name

      <gi>handNote</gi>, <gi>handShift</gi>, <gi>scriptNote</gi>, and
      <gi>typeNote</gi> elements) now permits multiple values from its
      enumerated list of values.</item>

      <item>The prose of the Guidelines and the element specification
      for <gi>list</gi> have been changed to differentiate between the
      <att>type</att> attribute, which should be used to identify the
      category of list, and the rendering attributes (<att>rend</att>,
      <att>style</att>, and <att>rendition</att>) which should be used
      to indicate how the list is rendered. Per <ptr
      target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/460/"/>.</item>

	<item>The element specification for <gi>education</gi> was
	enhanced to show an example using the <att>from</att> and
	<att>to</att> attributes as well as the <att>notBefore</att>
	and <att>notAfter</att> attributes, to suggest more precise
	ways of indicating dates, if appropriate. Per <ptr
	target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/654/"/>.</item>

        <item>The <att>new</att> attribute is now mandatory on the
        <gi>shift</gi> element as per <ptr
        target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/512/"/>.</item>

        <item>The content model of <gi>geogFeat</gi> and
        <gi>offset</gi> is now <name
        type="macro">macro.phraseSeq</name>, making them parallel to
        <gi>geogName</gi> per <ptr
        target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/feature-requests/460/"/>.</item>

	<item>The <gi>listRelation</gi> element and members of <name
	type="class">model.headLike</name> are now permitted as
	children of <gi>listRelation</gi> per <ptr
	target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/658/"/>.</item>

	<item>A new metadata element, <gi>punctuation</gi>, has been
	added to <name type="class">model.editorialDeclPart</name> for
	describing editorial practice with respect to punctuation
	marks.</item>

	<item>The <gi>surfaceGrp</gi> element was removed from <name
	type="class">att.coordinated</name>, thus losing the
	<att>start</att>, <att>ulx</att>, <att>uly</att>,
	<att>lrx</att>, <att>lry</att>, and <att>points</att>
	attributes, per <ptr
	target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/679/"/>.</item>

	<item>The discussion of the content of
	<gi>publicationStmt</gi> was altered to match the schema per
	<ptr
	target="https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/685/"/>.</item>

	<item>And, of course, dozens of typos were corrected.</item>

      </list>
      </p>

      <p>In addition, improvements have been made to the XSL
      stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma
      and OxGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets
      are maintained separately from the Guidelines and are at <ref
